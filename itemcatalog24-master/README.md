About:

This project is a RESTful web application utilizing the Flask framework which accesses a SQL database that populates categories and their items. OAuth2 provides authentication for further CRUD functionality on the application. Currently OAuth2 is implemented for Google Accounts.

This project has one main Python module application.py which runs the Flask application. A SQL database is created using the database.py module and you can populate the database with test data using menu.py.
